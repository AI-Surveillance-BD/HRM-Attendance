## 1.Introduction

HRM is a system for gathering and storing information on an organization's employees. The essential features required for end-to-end HR management are covered by Human Resource Information Systems. 

Keeping track of working hours has always been a difficult task. Several systems for recording employee presence have been developed throughout the years. The time card, perforated clock, and time sheets are the most common of these classic manual attendance recording devices. 

The requirement to precisely record workers' working hours became a fundamental aspect of business administration in the twentieth century. Employees have been protected by legislation, which ensures that they are adequately compensated. Companies have begun to track employee time in a variety of ways. 

While these technologies allowed businesses to track employee time, they were not without flaws. Card punching systems have a number of drawbacks, including the potential of human mistake, the possibility of time theft, and the time-consuming nature of manual attendance recording. 

However, if we deploy an AI monitoring system, we can prevent time theft while also increasing efficiency and production.

## 2.Challenges of face detection with AI
### 3D Mask Attack 
In this sort of spoofing, an intruder creates a 3D face mask of a target client and uses it to obtain system access.
