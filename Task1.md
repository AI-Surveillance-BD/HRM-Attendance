To start off, i would suggest you to learn how to create your own CascadeClassifier. You can follow along this method: https://realpython.com/face-detection-in-python-using-a-webcam/

As you can see in the following screenshot, the CascadeClassifier method detects a face which is a photograph.

Think of some solution that can prevent this issue. 

My opinion: Real human face will have eye movements, facial expressions,and head movements.
